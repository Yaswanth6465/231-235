        <h1><center>Leveraging Distance<br>
Education Through the<br>
Internet: A Paradigm Shift in<br>
Higher Education<br></center></h1>

        <div class="p2">
            In a global knowledge-based economy, with an ever-growing demand for<br>
learning, the Internet is seen as a vehicle for promoting effectiveness in<br>
teaching and reaching wider audiences. The number of online courses and<br>
programs offered by traditional higher education institutions, as well as new<br>
players in the education industry, has been increasing at an exponential rate.<br>
Yet the implementation of distance education through the Internet involves<br>
much more than a change of medium from face-to-face classroom interaction<br>
to an environment free of time and place constraints. Institutions are faced<br>
with the challenge of redefining their strategies to incorporate the e-learning<br>
paradigm. This chapter provides an overview of the different models that have<br>
emerged, and addresses the key issues that need to be resolved for integrating<br>
Internet-based learning in traditional universities. The breadth of strategic,<br>
administrative, academic and technological concerns encountered through<br>
the evolution of an Internet-based education system, from its inception to<br>
implementation, are discussed and illustrated by the e-learning initiative of<br>
Middle East Technical University in Turkey.<br><hr>
      </div>
<h2><center>INTRODUCTION</center></h2> 
        
        <div class="p3">
The history of distance education can be traced back to the mid-<br>Nineteenth century, when correspondence courses for teaching foreign lan-<br>guages by mail emerged in Europe. A hundred years later, televised courses<br>
heralded a new era. Distance courses were now enriched through sound and<br>
motion, and students were able to view classroom settings in their own homes.<br>
Commercial television stations started broadcasting university courses; a<br>
number of universities such as the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill<br>
setup their own television stations. Televised instruction paved the way to the<br>
success of Open Universities. The advent of videocassette recorders, and<br>
later, CD-ROMs further removed the time constraint imposed by television<br>
program schedules. But it is the pervasiveness of the Internet in all facets of<br>
society that set the stage for the biggest revolution in distance learning and<br>
higher education.<br>
The Internet has redefined the boundaries and promise of distance<br>
education by enabling the concurrent obliteration of time and place<br>
restrictions. Distance education through the Internet presents unprec-<br>edented opportunities for learners as well as providers of education.<br>
Learners can follow courses at anytime and from anywhere, at their own<br>
pace. Providers can reach a much wider and diverse population of learners<br>
than ever before, increasing their outreach and productivity. The use of<br>
new technologies also offers providers the potential to strengthen the<br>
quality and effectiveness of instruction.<br>
However, distance education over the Internet entails much more than just<br>
a change of medium for the delivery of instruction. There are many stakeholders<br>
involved, each with a different perspective and set of priorities. The change is one<br>
that deeply affects the university as an institution, and the instructor and the student<br>
as individuals. For the university, the transition to an Internet-based learning<br>
environment requires a restatement of institutional missions and priorities, a<br>
revision of conventional structures. For the instructor and student, online courses<br>
represent a shift in educational philosophy and instructional design as the<br>
emphasis moves from “teaching” to “learning,” leading to a student-centered<br>
rather than instructor-based system. The challenge for higher education is to find<br>
the best way to adjust to this paradigm.<br>
Over the last few years, there has been an exponential growth in the<br>
number of courses, certificate and degree programs available through the<br>
Internet. In the United States (U.S.), the percentage of post-secondary<br>
institutions using the Internet as the predominant mode of delivery for<br>
distance education almost tripled from 1995 to 1998 (National Education<br>
Association, 2000). These trends are expected to continue due to several<br>
reasons:<br><hr>

             </div>
       
            
 <div class="p4">  
   • In a global knowledge economy, higher education establishments are<br>
faced with a growing demand for learning from people of all ages. The<br>
U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statis-<br>tics (NCES) estimated that in the 1997-98 academic year over 1.6<br>
million students were enrolled in distance education courses offered by<br>
post-secondary institutions. This represents a twofold increase from<br>
1995. A similar growth pattern was observed on the provider side: the<br>
number of credit-granting distance education courses offered by higher<br>
education institutions doubled between 1995 and 1998 (National Edu-<br>cation Association, 2000). The National Household Education Survey<br>
(NHES) also shows that nearly half of the adult population in the United<br>
States is engaged in continuing education, of which more than half are<br>
studying for professional development (Kellogg Commission, 1999).<br>
Corporate sector spending for employee training and development rose<br>
to $2.9 billion dollars in 1999 (Ubell, 2000).<br>
• The convergence of information and communication technologies is<br>
increasing the power and spread of global communication. Information<br>
accessibility and availability is accelerating, while the associated costs<br>
are decreasing. In the U.S., Internet access in households has risen by<br>
123% since 1997. Over 40% of households now have access to the<br>
Internet (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2000). The Gartner Group<br>
predicts that by 2005, 75% of U.S. households will be connected to the<br>
Internet (Gartner Group, 2000).<br>
• There is rising competition among providers of distance education. Just<br>
as the Internet brings increased educational opportunities for learners, it<br>
also means that the target student population for providers is no longer<br>
limited by geographic proximity. With over a hundred million students<br>
enrolled in higher education worldwide (U.S. Department of Education,<br>
The Web-based Education Commission, 2000), competition for this<br>
global market is not only among higher education establishments, but<br>
also between traditional universities and new players in the education<br>
industry. A large number of for profit and nonprofit organizations have<br>
emerged as providers and brokers of education; e-learning portals,<br>
service providers and virtual universities are a reality today.<br>
Thus, the very structure of higher and continuing education is changing.<br>
In a knowledge-based society, the demand for learning will expand. Enroll-<br>ments in higher education are expected to continue to increase over the next<br>
decade (U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education<br>
Statistics, 2000). The International Data Corporation (IDC) projects that the<br>
distance education market will grow at a compounded annual rate of 33% over<br>
